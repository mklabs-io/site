I haven't had the opportunity to return to blogging activity as much as I wanted, but no matter what your tech inclination inside the DC might be, whether you're Cisco/Dell/IBM/HP/VMware/... oriented, I still think you'll find this technology a cool one. Yes, I can't resist to jump out of the Datacenter to share an exciting Startup company: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/09/cota-by-ossia-wireless-power/" target="_blank">Cota</a>.
These guys want to bring to the market a Power Charger that works via... <em>Wi-Fi</em>. Yes, you read it right. We're talking about using similar spectrum from current Wi-Fi (2.4GHz or 5GHz) to charge your mobile devices. And yes, no line-of-sight is needed, just like Wi-Fi signal can cross walls; though not without suffering likewise from interference on your charging power.
Can't help to wonder if <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android" target="_blank">Peeble got 10M on Kickstarter</a>, how much would this get? (And I do buy into the whole tech wearables concept!)
